# Features

This project tested my knowledge of CLI's and the use of node,js to accomplish that. This CLI comesup and asks you a series of prompts and takes those answers and generates them into a README.md file or in this case, a sampleREADME.md file. You would be able to use this generator for nay future projects so it doesnt take away from you time in actually creating the project.
